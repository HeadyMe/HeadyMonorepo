# Copilot Coding Agent Setup Guide

This repository is configured to work with GitHub Copilot's Coding Agent for automated fixes, builds, and testing.

## Prerequisites

Before the Copilot Coding Agent can work with this repository, you need to complete the following setup steps:

### 1. Organization/Repository Settings

For each relevant organization (HeadyMe and HeadySystems):

1. **Enable Copilot Coding Agent:**
   - Navigate to Organization Settings → Copilot → Policies
   - Enable the "Copilot coding agent" feature
   - Add the following repositories to the allowlist:
     - `HeadyMe/Heady`
     - `HeadyMe/main`
     - `HeadySystems/sandbox`
     - `HeadySystems/Heady`
     - `HeadySystems/HeadyConnection`

2. **Configure Repository Access:**
   - Go to each repository's Settings
   - Navigate to Actions → General
   - Ensure GitHub Actions are **enabled**
   - Set workflow permissions to "Read and write permissions"
   - Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

### 2. Install the GitHub Copilot Coding Agent App

1. If prompted, install the **Copilot Coding Agent GitHub App** for your organization
2. Grant it access to the repositories listed above
3. Ensure it has the following permissions:
   - **Code**: Read and write
   - **Pull requests**: Read and write
   - **Issues**: Read
   - **Actions**: Read and write
   - **Checks**: Write

### 3. Repository Permissions

Verify the following for each repository:

- Pull requests to `main` branch

**What it does:**
- Sets up Node.js and Python environments
- Installs dependencies
- Runs Python syntax checks

### 3. Security Scan (`security.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main`
- Weekly schedule (Mondays at 2 AM UTC)

**What it does:**

- Tests MCP configuration
- Validates Node.js and Python syntax

## Testing the Copilot Coding Agent

Once you've completed the setup steps above, you can test if the agent is enabled:

1. **Create a Test Issue:**
   ```
   Title: Test Copilot Coding Agent
   Body: @github-copilot please create a PR to fix linting errors in this repository
   ```

2. **Monitor the Response:**
   - The Copilot Coding Agent should respond and create a PR
   - If it doesn't respond, verify the setup steps above

3. **Check Workflow Runs:**
   - Go to Actions tab
   - Verify that workflows are running on PRs
   - Check that automated checks are completing

## Usage Examples

### Asking Copilot to Fix Build Errors

In an issue or PR comment:
```
@github-copilot Please fix all build errors in this repository
```

### Asking Copilot to Fix Linting Issues

In an issue or PR comment:
```
@github-copilot Please fix all ESLint errors in heady-manager.js
```

### Asking Copilot to Fix Security Vulnerabilities

In an issue or PR comment:
```
@github-copilot Please fix all security vulnerabilities found in npm audit
```

### Asking Copilot to Update Dependencies

In an issue or PR comment:
```
@github-copilot Please update all outdated npm packages to their latest versions
```

## Automated Fix Workflow

When the Copilot Coding Agent is enabled and a PR is created:

1. **Automated Checks Run:**
   - The `automated-fixes.yml` workflow executes
   - All checks are performed (lint, build, test, security)
   - Results are posted as a comment on the PR

2. **Review the Results:**
   - Check the automated comment for the status of each check
   - Review any failures that need attention

3. **Request Fixes:**
   - Comment on the PR with `@github-copilot` to request specific fixes
   - The agent will analyze the issues and propose solutions

4. **Approve and Merge:**
   - Once all checks pass, review the changes
   - Approve and merge the PR

## Troubleshooting

### Copilot Coding Agent Not Responding

1. Verify organization/repo settings are correct
2. Check that the GitHub App is installed
3. Ensure repository has Actions enabled
4. Verify your user has appropriate permissions

### Workflow Failures

1. Check the Actions tab for detailed logs
2. Verify all required secrets are configured
3. Ensure dependencies are up to date
4. Review the automated checks summary

### Permission Errors

1. Go to Settings → Actions → General
2. Set workflow permissions to "Read and write permissions"
3. Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
4. Verify the Copilot Coding Agent app has correct permissions

## Best Practices

1. **Keep PRs Small:** Smaller PRs are easier for the agent to analyze and fix
2. **Descriptive Titles:** Use clear, descriptive titles for issues and PRs
3. **Specific Requests:** Be specific when asking Copilot to fix issues
4. **Review Changes:** Always review automated fixes before merging
5. **Incremental Fixes:** Fix issues incrementally rather than all at once
