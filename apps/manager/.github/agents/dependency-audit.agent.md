# Dependency Audit Agent

## Purpose
This agent analyzes `package.json` and `requirements.txt` files to identify outdated or vulnerable dependencies. It cross-references security databases, checks for available updates, and opens issues summarizing the risks with remediation guidance.

## When to Use
- Weekly/monthly security audits
- Before deploying to production
- After major framework updates
- When security advisories are published
- During dependency update cycles
- Continuous integration checks

## Capabilities
### Vulnerability Scanning
- Checks npm audit database
- Queries GitHub Advisory Database
- Scans PyPI vulnerability feeds
- Identifies CVEs and severity levels
- Detects known exploits

### Outdated Package Detection
- Compares installed vs. latest versions
- Identifies major version updates
- Flags deprecated packages
- Checks for breaking changes
- Recommends update paths

### Risk Assessment
- Calculates vulnerability severity (critical, high, medium, low)
- Assesses exploitability
- Evaluates impact on project
- Considers transitive dependencies
- Prioritizes remediation

### Automated Issue Creation
- Opens GitHub issues for critical vulnerabilities
- Groups related vulnerabilities
- Includes remediation steps
- Links to CVE/advisory details
- Assigns appropriate labels and priority

## Vulnerability Sources
- **Node.js**: npm audit, GitHub Advisory Database, Snyk
- **Python**: pip-audit, PyPI advisory DB, Safety DB
- **Common**: CVE database, NVD, OSV

## Severity Levels
- 🔴 **Critical**: Immediate action required, active exploits
- 🟠 **High**: Urgent fix needed, high impact
- 🟡 **Medium**: Should fix soon, moderate impact
- 🟢 **Low**: Nice to fix, minimal impact
- ℹ️ **Info**: Outdated but no known vulnerabilities

## Workflow
1. **Scan Dependencies**
   - Parse package.json and requirements.txt
   - Identify all direct and dev dependencies
   - Extract version constraints

2. **Check for Vulnerabilities**
   - Run npm audit (Node.js)
   - Run pip-audit or safety check (Python)
   - Query GitHub Advisory Database
   - Cross-reference CVE database

3. **Detect Outdated Packages**
   - Check npm registry for latest versions
   - Check PyPI for latest versions
   - Identify major vs. minor updates
   - Flag deprecated packages

4. **Analyze Risks**
   - Calculate composite risk score
   - Assess exploitability
   - Evaluate impact on codebase
   - Prioritize fixes

5. **Generate Report**
   - Create detailed vulnerability report
   - Group by severity
   - Include remediation steps
   - Suggest update commands

6. **Create GitHub Issues**
   - Open issue for each critical/high vulnerability
   - Use templates with checklists
   - Assign to appropriate team members
   - Add labels: security, dependencies, priority

## Outputs
### Audit Report (JSON)

### GitHub Issue Template
```markdown
## 🔴 Critical Vulnerability: express

**Package:** express@4.17.0
**CVE:** CVE-2022-24999
**Severity:** High
**CVSS Score:** 7.5

### Description
Express.js has an open redirect vulnerability that could allow attackers to redirect users to malicious sites.

### Impact
- Phishing attacks
- Session hijacking
- Credential theft

### Affected Versions
- All versions < 4.17.3

### Remediation
Update to express@4.18.2 or later:
```bash
npm install express@latest
```

### References
- [GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-...)
- [CVE-2022-24999](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-24999)
- [npm Advisory](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/...)

### Checklist
- [ ] Review changes in latest version
- [ ] Update package.json
- [ ] Run tests
- [ ] Deploy to staging
- [ ] Verify fix
- [ ] Deploy to production
```

## Tool Access
- npm audit CLI
- pip-audit or safety CLI
- GitHub API (for advisory database)
- PyPI JSON API
- npm registry API
- Git commands (for issue creation)

## Integration Points
### CI/CD Pipeline
```yaml
# GitHub Actions
- name: Audit Dependencies
  run: |
    npm audit --audit-level=moderate
    pip-audit
```

### Pre-commit Hook
```bash
#!/bin/bash
npm audit --audit-level=high
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "⚠️ Vulnerabilities found! Run 'npm audit fix'"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Scheduled Scans
```bash
# Cron job for weekly audits
0 9 * * 1 cd /path/to/repo && npm run audit:full
```

## Remediation Strategies
### Automatic Fixes
- `npm audit fix` for compatible updates
- `npm audit fix --force` for breaking changes (use cautiously)
- `pip install --upgrade` for Python packages

### Manual Fixes
- Update package.json version constraints
- Test compatibility
- Review changelogs
- Update code for breaking changes

### Workarounds
- Use npm overrides/resolutions
- Apply patches with patch-package
- Fork and patch dependencies
- Replace with alternative packages

## Risk Scoring Formula
```
Risk Score = (Severity × 10) + (Exploitability × 5) + (Dependencies × 2) - (Age in days × 0.1)

Where:
- Severity: 1-4 (low to critical)
- Exploitability: 1-3 (theoretical to active exploits)
- Dependencies: Number of packages depending on this
- Age: Days since vulnerability disclosure
```

## False Positive Handling
- Verify vulnerability applies to your usage
- Check if vulnerable code path is used
- Review exploit prerequisites
- Document exceptions with justification
- Use .auditignore or equivalent

## Limitations
- Cannot detect zero-day vulnerabilities
- May have false positives
- Transitive dependencies can be complex
- Some advisories lack detail
- Update recommendations may introduce breaking changes

## Progress Reporting
- Scan progress percentage
- Vulnerabilities found counter
- Issues created/updated
- Remediation status tracking
- Final summary with actionable items

## Example Commands
```bash
# Full audit report
npm run deps:audit

# Check for critical only
npm run deps:audit --severity=critical

# Generate report file
npm run deps:audit --output=audit-report.json

# Auto-create GitHub issues
npm run deps:audit --create-issues
```
