## Verification Checklist

After configuring all settings, verify:

- [ ] GitHub Actions are enabled
- [ ] Workflow permissions are set to "Read and write"
- [ ] "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" is enabled
- [ ] Branch protection rules are configured for `main`
- [ ] Copilot Coding Agent is enabled for the repository
- [ ] All required secrets are configured
- [ ] Code security features are enabled
- [ ] Team/collaborator access is configured
- [ ] CODEOWNERS file is present and valid
- [ ] Issue templates are configured
- [ ] PR template is configured

## Testing the Configuration

1. **Create a test branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test/copilot-config
   git push -u origin test/copilot-config
   ```

2. **Open a test PR:**
   - Create a PR from `test/copilot-config` to `main`
   - Verify that automated workflows run
   - Check that the PR template is used
   - Confirm that Code Owners are automatically assigned

3. **Test Copilot integration:**
   - Comment on the PR: `@github-copilot Can you help review this PR?`
   - Verify that Copilot responds

4. **Verify security scanning:**
   - Push a commit with a test secret (e.g., API key)
   - Verify that push protection catches it
   - Remove the secret and push again

5. **Check workflow permissions:**
   - Verify that workflows can comment on PRs
   - Check that workflow runs show in the PR checks

## Troubleshooting

### Workflows Not Running

- Check that Actions are enabled in repository settings
- Verify workflow files are in `.github/workflows/`
- Check workflow syntax with `yamllint`
- Review Actions tab for error messages

### Permission Errors

- Verify workflow permissions in Settings → Actions → General
- Check individual workflow permissions in YAML files
- Ensure GITHUB_TOKEN has necessary scopes

### Copilot Not Responding

- Verify Copilot is enabled in organization settings
- Check that repository is in the allowlist
- Ensure the Copilot app is installed
- Verify app permissions

### Secret Scanning Issues

- Ensure secret scanning is enabled
- Check that patterns match your secrets
- Verify push protection is configured
- Review secret scanning alerts
