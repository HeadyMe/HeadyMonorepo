# HeadySystems - Remaining Tasks & Merge Readiness

## 🚧 Outstanding Tasks

### High Priority
- [ ] **Integration Test**: Verify `demo.html` runs successfully with the `filesystem` MCP server connected.
- [ ] **Security Review**: Audit `heady-manager-unified.js` for potential path traversal issues in MCP config loading (currently safe, but verify).
- [ ] **GPU Worker**: Re-enable actual GPU worker connection logic (currently mocked in Unified Manager).

### Medium Priority
- [ ] **Frontend Build**: The `frontend/` directory has a Vite React app that isn't fully integrated into the Manager's static serving (it serves `public/`). Consider building it to `public/app/`.
- [ ] **Python Worker**: Ensure `src/process_data.py` is robust and handles new QA request formats from the unified manager.

### Low Priority
- [ ] **Legacy Cleanup**: Remove `heady-manager.js` and `heady-manager-enhanced.js` once Unified is fully stable.
- [ ] **Documentation**: Expand `patent_info.md` with new "Cognitive Interleaving" implementation details from the Orchestrator.

## ✅ Completed in this Session
- [x] **Unified Architecture**: Merged Security, Orchestration, and File Ops into `heady-manager-unified.js`.
- [x] **HeadyIDE**: Applied Sacred Geometry theme and improved file tree/editor layout.
- [x] **Automation**: Created `public/demo.html` for self-driving system demonstration.
- [x] **Design System**: Centralized tokens in `public/css/heady-theme.css`.
- [x] **MCP Integration**: Added native MCP Client support to the Node.js manager.
- [x] **HeadyE Initialization**: Created base Electron app with React UI overlay (Checkpoint: `HeadyE/checkpoints/init_complete.md`)

## 🚀 Merge Readiness
- **Status**: Ready for Squash Merge (Pending final manual verification of demo).
- **Entry Point**: `heady-manager-unified.js`
- **Config**: `mcp_config.json` (Ensure paths are absolute or relative to CWD)
