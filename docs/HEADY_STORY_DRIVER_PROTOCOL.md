# HEADY STORY DRIVER PROTOCOL (HSDP) v1.0

**Concept:** Angle-Adjustable Process Narration  
**Goal:** Transform static system logs into dynamic, multi-perspective stories (Technical, Business, Health)  
**Status:** Active Protocol  
**Integration:** HeadyManager, HeadyAcademy, Checkpoint System

---

## 1. THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

We do not write "logs." We write **State Snapshots**. Every event in the system is a micro-story waiting to be told. The "Reader" (User/Dev/AI) determines the *angle* of the story, not the writer.

### The Three Angles

1. **The Mechanic (Technical):** Cold, precise, causal. Focuses on stack traces, memory addresses, and execution flow.
2. **The Observer (Business):** Empathetic, outcome-oriented. Focuses on user intent, success/failure, and value.
3. **The Doctor (Health):** Organic, physiological. Focuses on system stress, "sweating" (latency), and resource exhaustion.

---

## 2. THE DATA STRUCTURE (The "Context Vector")

Every significant system event MUST be mapped to this JSON schema. This is the DNA of the Story Driver.

```json
{
  "event_id": "UUID_v4",
  "timestamp": "ISO_8601_UTC",
  "source_component": "service_name_or_module",
  
  "raw_data": {
    "log_level": "INFO | WARN | ERROR",
    "message": "Raw system output",
    "payload": "Optional: input_params or data_object"
  },

  "narrative_angles": {
    "technical": {
      "execution_state": "BLOCKING | ASYNC | THREAD_LOCKED",
      "affected_resource": "DB_Connection_Pool | TCP_Socket | File_Handle",
      "stack_trace_signature": "Optional: ErrorType:File:Line",
      "fix_suggestion": "Optional: Automated hint"
    },

    "business": {
      "user_intent": "What was the user trying to do?",
      "user_impact": "NONE | DELAY | BLOCKER | DATA_LOSS",
      "user_visible_message": "Friendly error or success text",
      "process_goal": "The high-level objective"
    },

    "health": {
      "system_mood": "CALM | STRESSED | FRANTIC | EXHAUSTED",
      "vital_signs": {
        "cpu_load": "0-100%",
        "memory_pressure": "MB_used",
        "latency_ms": "Response time"
      },
      "condition": "Stable | Throttling | Leaking | Recovering"
    }
  },

  "story_meta": {
    "chapter": "Feature or Module Name",
    "role": "PROTAGONIST | ANTAGONIST | SUPPORT",
    "narrative_beat": "INCITING_INCIDENT | RISING_ACTION | CLIMAX | RESOLUTION"
  }
}
```

---

## 3. INTEGRATION WITH HEADY CHECKPOINT SYSTEM

### Checkpoint Story Generation

When `checkpoint_reporter.js` generates a checkpoint, it MUST invoke the Story Driver to create narrative summaries:

```javascript
const storyDriver = require('./heady_story_driver');

// After checkpoint creation
const narrativeSummary = await storyDriver.generateCheckpointStory({
  checkpoint: checkpointData,
  angle: 'all', // or 'technical', 'business', 'health'
  timeframe: '24h'
});
```

### Four States of Being

Every checkpoint and log entry falls into one of these states:

| State | Condition | Narrative Voice |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **I. CALM** | CPU < 20%, No Errors | Reflective. "I am resting, ready for input." |
| **II. FLOW** | CPU 20-60%, Regular Traffic | Professional. "Processing request. Data optimized." |
| **III. STRESS** | CPU 60-90%, Minor Errors | Tense. "Memory low. Dumping cache. Struggling." |
| **IV. PANIC** | CPU > 90%, Critical Errors | Fragmented. "FAILURE. DISCONNECT. REBOOT." |

---

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION FOR HEADY ECOSYSTEM

### A. Master Reference Generator Integration

The `master_reference_generator.js` should use Story Driver to create narrative documentation:

```javascript
// Add to master_reference_generator.js
const storyDriver = require('./heady_story_driver');

async function generateNarrativeReference(codebase) {
  const technicalView = await storyDriver.analyzeCodebase(codebase, 'technical');
  const businessView = await storyDriver.analyzeCodebase(codebase, 'business');
  
  return {
    technical: technicalView,
    business: businessView,
    combined: storyDriver.weaveNarratives([technicalView, businessView])
  };
}
```

### B. Governance Logging Enhancement

Update `lens_stream.json` entries to include narrative angles:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-02-02T21:30:00Z",
  "event": "CHECKPOINT_CREATED",
  "context_vector": {
    "narrative_angles": {
      "technical": "Checkpoint system executed successfully in 234ms",
      "business": "User progress saved, enabling seamless resume",
      "health": "System CALM, all resources nominal"
    }
  }
}
```

## 5. HEADY-SPECIFIC NARRATIVE RULES

### The Fractal Voice

Stories must exhibit self-similarity at all scales:
- **Micro-level:** Individual function calls narrated
- **Meso-level:** Feature implementations narrated
- **Macro-level:** System evolution narrated

### The Sacred Geometry Aesthetic

Narrative structure follows organic, rounded patterns:
- Avoid harsh transitions ("THEN this broke")
- Use flowing language ("As the system breathed, pressure built...")
- Embrace circular storytelling (callbacks to earlier events)

### Cross-Modal Integrity Rule

**The Narrative and the System State must never contradict.**

If the Health Angle reports "PANIC," the Technical Angle cannot report "All systems nominal."

## 6. USAGE IN HEADY PROJECTS

### Command 1: Generate Checkpoint Story

```bash
node src/heady_story_driver.js --checkpoint latest --angle all
```

### Command 2: Analyze Session

```bash
node src/heady_story_driver.js --session 2026-02-02 --output story.md
```

### Command 3: Real-time Narration

```bash
node src/heady_story_driver.js --watch --stream lens_stream.json
```

---

## 7. BENEFICIAL OUTCOMES

1. **Debugging becomes storytelling** - Understand system behavior through narrative
2. **Documentation writes itself** - Stories become technical docs
3. **Stakeholder communication** - Business angle for non-technical audiences
4. **System empathy** - Health angle reveals system "feelings"
5. **Audit trails with context** - Every event has a "why" not just a "what"

---

## 8. NEXT EVOLUTION

### Phase 1: Basic Implementation (Current)
- Context Vector schema defined
- Integration points identified
- Checkpoint system enhanced

### Phase 2: AI Narrator (Next)
- Local LLM generates prose from Context Vectors
- Style adapts to audience (technical vs. business)
- Automatic documentation generation

### Phase 3: Predictive Storytelling (Future)
- System predicts next chapter based on patterns
- Proactive alerts: "I sense a memory leak forming..."
- Self-healing narratives: "I detected the issue and resolved it..."

---

**Status:** Ready for integration with checkpoint_reporter.js and master_reference_generator.js
